Hi, I'm Dinesh Solanki, a software engineer from India. I am a technology enthusiast and love to explore new technologies. I have a passion for learning new things and sharing my knowledge with others.

When I am not coding, I like to spend my writing stories, prose, or poems, and watching movies,

You can also find me gaming or writing blogs on [Aprogrammers](https://aprogrammers.wordpress.com/).

## Writer's heart, Programmer's mind, and Gamer's soul.
